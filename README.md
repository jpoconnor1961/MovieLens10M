   - harvard_oconnor_movie_PDF file

   - harvard_oconnor_movie_RMD markdown file
   - 18 PNG image files to support the figures coded in the markdown file
   - ref.bibtex file that supports the markdown file
- If you have problems with "Knit to PDF" from the open markdown file tab, you may need to install or update your LaTeX distribution package (e.g., TinyTex, MiKTeX, TeX Live, etc.).
