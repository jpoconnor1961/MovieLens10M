Download & Install Instructions for Project Folder/Files in R:
- In your web browser enter the following URL into the address bar:  https://github.com/jpoconnor1961/MovieLens10M
- In the GitHub MovieLens10M repository, click on the green button that says "Code", and then click on the "Download ZIP" choice in the dropdown menu.
- In your FileManager, extract the zip folder "MovieLens10M-main" that was downloaded.  This will create a new "MovieLens10M" folder that will contain another nested "MovieLens10M" folder that will contain a "harvard-oconnor-movie" folder which contains all the project files.
- In your R application, select "New Project" and then select an "Existing Directory".  Next, navigate to the "harvard-oconnor-movie" folder to select that as the working directory, and then select the "Create Project" button at the bottom-right-side of the dialog box.
- The "harvard-oconnor-movie" working directory folder in your R application will contain the harvard_oconnor_movie_PDF file, the harvard_oconnor_movie_Rcode file, the harvard_oconnor_movie_RMD markdown file, 16 PNG image files to support the figures coded in the markdown file, and a ref.bibtex file that also supports the markdown file.
- If you have problems with "Knit to PDF" from the open markdown file tab, you may need to install or update your LaTeX distribution package (e.g., TinyTex, MiKTeX, TeX Live, etc.).
